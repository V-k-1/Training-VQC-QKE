# Training-VQC-QKE
This is a tutorial in which I show how to train variational quantum circuits to perform binary classification in the Sloan digitial sky survey dataset. 
I further solve the same classification problem using support vector machines using a quantum kernel for feature transformation.

The SDSS dataset consists of photometric fluxes in different wavelength bands from stars/galaxies, and the object's redshift. 
The target is the object type - star/galaxy.
